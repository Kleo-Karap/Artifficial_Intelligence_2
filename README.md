Sentiment classification: From ML to DL to very DL models

This repo contains code implementations and report for developing a multiclass sentiment classifier using 4 different approaches:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNNs)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTM/GRU cells + Attention
4. Finetuning GreekBERT and DistilGreekBERT for Sequence classification
